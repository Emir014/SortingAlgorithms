# Sorting Algorithms

This project includes implementations of two popular sorting algorithms: Merge Sort in Java and Quick Sort in C++. Each implementation demonstrates the fundamental principles of the respective sorting algorithm and is designed to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Java Files

- `src/MergeSort.java`: A Java program that implements the Merge Sort algorithm. The program generates a large array of random integers, sorts it using the Merge Sort algorithm, and prints the sorted array.

### C++ Files

- `src/quickSort.cpp`: A C++ program that implements the Quick Sort algorithm. The program sorts a predefined array of integers and prints the sorted array.
